			<p><strong>Running</strong> is a popular form of exercise for a reason. It doesn’t need much equipment, and you can do it just about anywhere or anytime it is convenient for you. <strong>Plus</strong>, experts say it improves <strong>heart health</strong>.Improved knee and back health. A study of 675 marathon runners found that they had a lower arthritis rate than other <em>people</em>. The runners’ knees and backs were both positively affected. <em>The more you run, the lower your odds of back problems as you age</em>.If you find that you have problems with your memory, get running. It affects your brain in the short and long term. Aerobic exercise gets your heart rate up and makes you <em>sweat</em>. This can boost the size of your <em>hippocampus</em>, the part of the brain responsible for <strong>memory</strong> and learning.</p>

			<h2>Running research</h2>
			<p>If you're a <strong>runner</strong>, are you concerned about how to improve your economy? If so, you can literally breathe easily: new research from <strong>Odense University</strong> in Denmark shows you a straight-forward way to do it - and reveals a surprising mechanism by which economy improves.In the Danish investigation, researchers worked with 36 experienced <em>male</em> runners with an average VO2max of 54.8 ml/kg/min, which predicts a 5K race time of about 18:22 (5:56 per mile). Prior to the study, the runners had been training about 2.2 hours <em>per week</em>, usually by running continuously at moderate intensities (Improved Running Economy Following Intensified Training Correlates with Reduced Ventilatory Demands, Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise, vol. 30(8), pp. 1250-1256, 1998).The researchers divided the 36 runners into three groups. Three times a week, members of one group carried out tempo runs at about their predicted half-marathon race pace of 6:26 per mile - roughly 14 seconds per mile slower than their potential 10K race speed. For three weeks, these runs were 20 minutes in duration; for the final <em>three weeks</em> of the study, the tempo runs were expanded to <em>30 minutes</em>. On non-tempo-run days, the subjects simply ran easily for about 30 minutes (there were an average of two easy days per week).A second group avoided tempo running completely, relying instead on long intervals to improve their fitness. Three times a week, the runners in this group completed four-minute work intervals at a pace of 5:49 per mile, just slightly faster than their predicted 5K race velocity. These four-minute intervals were punctuated with two-minute recoveries. Initially, the <strong>long-interval</strong> runners completed three work intervals per workout, but they moved up to five intervals per session after three weeks. As was the case with the tempo trainers, the long-interval runners simply ran easily on recovery days.Finally, members of the third group of runners utilized very short intervals during the three quality workouts they carried out each week. These sessions were composed of 15-second bursts at 4:44 per mile pace, which would correspond closely with the runners' best average velocity for 400-metre competitions. The intense bursts were alternated with 15-second recovery jogs, and the runners completed about <em>40 reps</em> (ie, 15-second blasts) per workout. <em>Easy running was carried out on non-quality days.</em></p>
